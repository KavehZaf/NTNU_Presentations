\begin{itemize}
\item The process (TTO collaboration) is an excellent way to learn marketing. TTO provides hands on experience.
\item Real cases might have details you have not considered in your research.
\item Real cases are practiced differently in different locations. For example electricity market is running differently in Nordic countries than US.

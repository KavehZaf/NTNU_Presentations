\begin{frame}{Challenges in the planning and operation of the grid}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> \textbf{Planning:} Optimizing the right type, size and timing of new grid investments
\begin{itemize}
\item Local generation (e.g. PV) and increased load (e.g. EVs)  can be located in areas where the grid is weak
\item Energy storage and demand flexibility are alternatives to grid reinforcements
\end{itemize}

\item<2-> \textbf{Operation:}Optimize the use of controllable assets such as energy storage and flexible demand to secure, reliable and economic operation of the distribution grids. This means:
\begin{itemize}
\item Making the right use of Demand Response
\item being able to value the use of end-user flexibility for local or system-wide grid services
\item Simulating and optimizing the grids in the presence of \textbf{future local markets for energy and flexibility}

\begin{block}{Notes}
{\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Classical single-period OPF does not offer a possibility for optimal operational scheduling of storage and flexible demand
\item<2->  We therefore aim to develop the foundations for a new generation of Multi-Period OPF (MPOPF) solvers
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
{\tiny
\item Solves the OPF problem over several coupled time-steps
\item Computation time is an issue when using both commercial or free optimization solvers
}
\end{enumerate}
\item<3-> MPOPF is an extremely challenging scientific task:
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
{\tiny
\item Nonlinearity
\item Large-scale problem with respect with to time and space
\item Involves stochastic generations and load}

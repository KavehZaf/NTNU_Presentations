\begin{frame}{Primary Frequency Control}
\begin{block}{Notation}
{\tiny To represent the primary frequency control, we connect a mass to the fulcrum of the beam to lower
the center of mass of the scale. Moreover, we add mechanical dampers. Whenever an unbalanced condition occurs, the scale will start to oscillate
but the effect of the damper will prevent a sustained oscillation around the equilibrium point. Then the
new equilibrium is given by the sum of the momenta of the three masses, generators, loads and
primary frequency control.}

\begin{frame}{Secondary Frequency Control}
\begin{block}{Notation}
{\tiny This is basically just a
rescheduling of the active power set point of the turbines of the synchronous machines. The AGC is
much slower than the primary frequency control and in the mechanical model its effect
is mainly visible at the equilibrium. The representation in the figure is simplistic, however. In practice all generators will increase their power production to compensate a generator outage or a load
increase.}

Frequency stability here mainly referred to the ability of securing the frequency above a threshold
\end{block}

\begin{enumerate}

\item<1-> The current response of the primary frequency reserve in the Nordic synchronous area does not ensure frequency stability in low inertia situation. \footnote{{\tiny[entsoe, "Fast frequency reserve-solution to the Nordic inertia challenge" 2019]}}
\item<2->  The volume needed to affect the minimum frequency by 0.1 in an 80 GWs system is 20 GWs \footnote{{\tiny[Ørum et al., Future system inertia 2, 2017]}}. The availability of different possible techniques are varies but the cost will be high.  
\item<3-> FFR is deemed the most promising mitigation solution for low inertia situation since several techniques can provide fast power response estimated at low socio-economic costs, either as a disconnection of load or fast increase from inverter-based generation and storage  \footnote{{\tiny[M. Kuivaniemi and E. A. Jansson, "FFR feasibility study," Unpublished report, 2019]}}

{\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Amount of inertia in the synchronous power system is proportional to the amount of rotating mass of synchronous generators and machines.
\item<2-> Massive integration of renewable energy generations, decommissioning of thermal and nuclear power plants (with synchronous generators), more and more dependence on HVDC import/export, all are parts of the road map toward expected near future.
\item<3-> TSO have an important role in shaping new emerging markets, by opening dialogue with market players and introduce flexibility in a socio-economical manner.
\item<4-> Pilot Project 2018:
\begin{enumerate}[I]
{\scriptsize
\item FFR is a cost efficient measure for handling of low inertia challenges.
\item Pilot project gave a profound understanding how FFR could be implemented and tested.
\item Pilot project gave an overview of how  flexibility could contribute to power system operational security.

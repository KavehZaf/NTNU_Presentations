Webinar Innovation,    
Invited for talk by Prof. Kjell Sand  
About the project:  
Large-scale integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) (Such as wind, solar, Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and Electric Vehicles (EV)) into the power systems distribution grid has been initiated to reduce the rate of CO2 emission, and to react to the increasing global warming. To achieve this, it is of great importance for power system engineers to analyse these resources impact and operate them in a reliable, cost-efficient, and computationally tractable manner.  
A Multi-Period AC Optimal Power Flow (MPOPF) Solver, “BATTPOWER”, has been developed at IEL, NTNU, in 2020:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9339880  
The goal of Discovery project is to deliver the first version of the solver to the industry partner: Taking a main step from research to industry usage. We aim for developing the foundations for a new generation of optimal power flow solvers that can handle all relevant DER in a computationally highly efficient way.

\begin{itemize}
\item <1-> \small Green shift in electircity systems is needed for the reduction of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> \tiny  Integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) is a huge challenge
\end{itemize}
\only<2>{ \begin{alertblock}{\tiny Note}
{\tiny DER includes Renewable Energy, Energy Storage, Electric Vehicles and Flexible Demand}
\end{alertblock}}
\item<3->\small Grid companies must be able to analyse the impacts of DER 
\only<4>{ \begin{alertblock}{Note}
\textbf{\tiny Optimal Power Flow (OPF)}{\tiny solvers are essential}
\end{alertblock}}
\item<5->\small The inegration of DER in smart grids calls for \textbf{much more sophisticated solvers} for OPF

\begin{frame}{Challenges in the planning and operation of the grid}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Planning:} Optimizing the right type, size and timing of new grid investments
\begin{itemize}
\item Local generation (e.g. PV) and increased load (e.g. EVs)  can be located in areas where the grid is weak
\item Energy storage and demand flexibility are alternatives to grid reinforcements
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Operation:}Optimize the use of controllable assets such as ESS and flexible demand to secure, reliable and economic operation of the distribution grids
\begin{itemize}
\item Making the right use of Demand Response and being able to value the use of end-user flexibility for local or system-wide grid services
\item Simulating and optimizing the grids in the presence of \textbf{local markets for energy and flexibility}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Notes}
{\scriptsize 
\begin{itemize}
\item Classical single-period OPF does not offer a possibility for optimal operational scheduling of storage and flexible demand
\item  We therefore aim to develop the foundations for a new generation of Multi-Period OPF (MPOPF) solvers 
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
{\tiny
\item Solves the OPF problem over several coupled time-steps
\item Computation time is an issue when using both commercial or free optimization solvers
}
\end{enumerate}
\item MPOPF is an extremely challenging scientific task:
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
{\tiny
\item Nonlinearity
\item Large-scale problem with respect with to time and space
\item Involves stochastic generations and load
\item Security of supply}
\end{enumerate}

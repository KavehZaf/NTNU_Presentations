\begin{itemize}
\item power system with suppliers and consumers
\item power generated cannot be stored largely, so it must be consumed

		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item<1-> \vskip -1cm Sustainability: {\footnotesize Need tools for analysing operating conditions resulting from renewables, EV, storage and flexible demand.}

			\item<2-> Economics: {\footnotesize Norway electric industry revenues of 61.6 billion NOK in 2018\footnote{\label{note1} \tiny https://www.nve.no/energy-market-and-regulation/retail-market/electricity-disclosure-2018/}. 1\% savings worth 615 million NOK (estimated using \textsuperscript{\ref{note1}} \textsuperscript{and} \footnote{\tiny{https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/Market-data1/Dayahead/Volumes/NO/Hourly/?view=table}})} 

			\item<3-> Reliability: {\footnotesize Annual cost of power interruptions to Norway economy is 1600 MNOK/year (estimated using \footnote{\tiny http://publikasjoner.nve.no/rapport/2018/rapport2018\_74.pdf} \textsuperscript{and} \footnote{\tiny Samdal, K., Kjolle, G.

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{block}{Highlights}
{\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Amount of inertia in the synchronous power system is proportional to the amount of rotating mass of synchronous generators and machines.
\item<2-> Massive integration of renewable energy generations, decommissioning of thermal and nuclear power plants (with synchronous generators), more and more dependence on HVDC import/export, all are parts of the road map toward expected near future.
\item<3-> TSO have an important role in shaping new emerging markets, by opening dialogue with market players and introduce flexibility in a socio-economical manner.
\item<4-> Pilot Project 2018:
\begin{enumerate}[I]
{\scriptsize
\item FFR is a cost efficient measure for handling of low inertia challenges.
\item Pilot project gave a profound understanding how FFR could be implemented and tested.
\item Pilot project gave an overview of how  flexibility could contribute to power system operational security.

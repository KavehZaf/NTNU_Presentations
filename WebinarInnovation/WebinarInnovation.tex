\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{block}{Highlights}
{\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Amount of inertia in the synchronous power system is proportional to the amount of rotating mass of synchronous generators and machines.
\item<2-> Massive integration of renewable energy generations, decommissioning of thermal and nuclear power plants (with synchronous generators), more and more dependence on HVDC import/export, all are parts of the road map toward expected near future.
\item<3-> TSO have an important role in shaping new emerging markets, by opening dialogue with market players and introduce flexibility in a socio-economical manner.
\item<4-> Pilot Project 2018:
\begin{enumerate}[I]
{\scriptsize
\item FFR is a cost efficient measure for handling of low inertia challenges.
\item Pilot project gave a profound understanding how FFR could be implemented and tested.
\item Pilot project gave an overview of how  flexibility could contribute to power system operational security.
